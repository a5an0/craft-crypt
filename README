What is Craft Crypt?
--------------------

Craft Crypt is a terminal-based application to send and recieve messages, through POP3 and SMTP (especially GMail), that are encrypted with Blowfish.

Status
------

Right now, most of the crypto is written. The string handling functions have some bugs that need to be worked out. The main handling code is in another project and needs to be worked in. Finally, the interface hasn't been built yet.
